# [Benuse](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/benuse/id1581388010), an iOS widget-based HN reader

## Why did you build this app?

There already exist some great native [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) clients for iOS.

I would recommend [Octal](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1308885491) for participating on Hacker News.

However, I find myself wanting to quickly browse headlines without browsing an app.

I'm a big fan of Apple's News widgets, which launch you directly into articles.

To teach create a visually and functionally similar reading experience for Hacker News, I proudly present: Benuse.

## How do I use it?

**Install Benuse from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/benuse/id1581388010**


When you launch Benuse for the first time, you'll be prompted to add the widgets to your home screen.

Follow [this guide][guide] to do so.
To select different Hacker News feeds, edit the widget by long-pressing it as described in the guide.

## What makes Benuse special?

- Uses the official [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).
- Built with modern, reactive SwiftUI. Native components/colors/feel.
- Faithful to the Hacker News web interface using an embedded browser.
- Supports the [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me) to show article images and site titles.
- Easy swipe navigation between stories and discussions.
- Features responsive layout with iPad compatibility.
- Lightweight.

## Do you have a cool demo video?

As a matter of fact, I do! I recommend unmuting the [music](https://soundcloud.com/floorbaba/disappear).

## Things don't work the way I would like.

This is a basic, unfinished project, and there are definitely bugs and features I'd still like to implement.

Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jrmann100/benuse/issues) to share your thoughts (or submit a pull request!)

However, I can make no guarantees on continued development.
